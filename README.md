# Movie-Recommendation

The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This R project is designed to understand the functioning of a recommendation system. Here we developed an Item Based Collaborative Filter. This will help gain experience of implementing my R, Data Science, and Machine learning skills in a real-life project.
